# BIO 294A Website
For the final assignment of BIO 294A, I have designed a website which houses two main things: (1) the concepts we covered in the course and (2) my reflections and feedback on the course.

## Access
The source code for the website is available on my GitHub. To access the site itself, you can go to: https://rickyysee.github.io/bio294a-website/
