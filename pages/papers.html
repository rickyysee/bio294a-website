    <h1>Course Curriculum</h1>
    <p>This course is a graduate-level course centered around research topics in cellular and molecular biology. We began the semester by having some introductory lectures on concepts of biology such as the central dogma and regulation of gene expression. In order to explore novel topics in cellular and molecular biology, the rest of our sessions were conducted as journal clubs, where a pair of students would lead the presentation and discussion on a research paper of their choosing. Below are the papers we discussed and my takeaways from them.</p>
