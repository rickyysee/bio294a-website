    <h2 class="top">Course Curriculum</h2>
    <p>This is a graduate-level course centered around research topics in cellular and molecular biology. We began the semester by having some introductory lectures on biological concepts such as the central dogma and regulation of gene expression.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In order to explore novel topics in cellular and molecular biology, the rest of our sessions were conducted as journal clubs, where a pair of students would lead a presentation and discussion on a research paper of their choosing. Below are the papers we discussed and my takeaways from them.</p>

                <h4>Surfactant protein C mutation links postnatal type 2 cell dysfunction to adult disease</h4>
                <p>Sitaraman et al. (2021)</p>
                <p class="paper-text">This paper was presented by Dr. T. The researchers here described a protein, surfactant protein C (SP-C), which is secreted by alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) cells and involved in surface tension regulation of lung epithelium. Mutations to the gene for this protein, <em>SFTPC</em>, have been linked to pulmonary diseases such as diffuse parenchymal and fibrotic lung disease. The researchers demonstrate that mutations to this gene may confer heightened risk of lung disease by impacting postnatal lung development. To this end, the researchers utilized a mutated mouse model, with a disease-associated <em>Sftpc</em> mutation, L188Q. They isolated lung tissue and epithelial cells during postnatal development to assess various toxicological endpoints.</p>

                <p class="paper-text">In Figure 1, Sitaraman et al. showed that their mouse model did indeed have impaired lung repair by inducing lung injury with bleomycin, which is a chemotherapy drug and pulmonary toxin. Lung tissue sections are shown from the wildtype (top) and mutant (bottom) mice, where we can see more inflammatory markers such as presence of lymphocytes and increased collagen.</p>

                <p class="paper-text">In Figure 2, we can see that the mutant mouse model also had reduced frequency of AT2 cells, demonstrated by colocalization of proSP-C and ABCA3 stains, markers of AT2 cells. The researchers also performed Western blot analysis and found that pro-SP-C seems to accumulate in mutant AT2 cells, with very low levels of mature SP-C detected. Importantly, this reduction persisted into adulthood.</p>

                    <img alt="figure showing increased oxidative stress in AT2 cells" class="figure" src="../images/paper1-figure4.png">
                    <p class="paper-text">The AT2 cells also seem to display increased oxidative stress, seen through fluorescence of DCDFA, a dye for reactive oxygen species, in the presence and absence of an oxidative stress inducer, tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP)</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="paper-text">The researchers were also able to link this increase in oxidative stress with increased apoptotic signaling and impaired differentiation in isolated AT2 cells.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="paper-text"> The presence of oxidative stress was consistent with genomic and proteomics data, which both showed increased expression of pathways involved in the stress response of mice. More specifically, cells isolated at postnatal day 4 had different proteomic profiles versus those isolated at postnatal day 21, suggesting adapatation to the toxicity.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="paper-text">Finally, the researchers assessed several stress response markers at postnatal day 4 and 21 in wildtype and mutant mice lung cells and found alterations to the ability to resolve stress.</p>
                <p class="paper-text">The results from this study indicate that a decrease in AT2 cells persisting into adulthood from postnatal development is a driving factor in stress associated with mutations of the <em>SFTPC</em> gene.</p>

            <h4>High-Efficiency Lentiviral Transduction of Human CD34+ Cells in High-Density Culture with Poloxamer and Prostaglandin E2</h4>
            <p>Uchida et al. (2019)</p>
            <p class="paper-text">This paper was presented by Lynzie and Alexis. This study explored factors that impact lentiviral transduction efficiency of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with genes of interest for its implication in gene therapy. The researchers have previously established a serum-free medium with "minimal cytokines" that improved transduction and here demonstrate that transducing higher-density cultures improves efficiency. They also identify two adjuvants, poloxamer 407 (P407) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), for transduction efficiency.</p>
            <br>
            <img alt="figure showing quantification of transduction at different cell densities" class="figure" src="../images/paper2-figure1.png">
            <p class="paper-text">To demonstrate that high-density cell cultures are optimal for transduction, the researchers transduced human CD34+ cells with a GFP-encoding lentiviral vector at different cell densities and quantified the amount of cells expressing GFP and the vector copy number, both of which increased in a dose-dependent manner. <br><br> The researchers also explored how alterations to multiplicity of infection can impact transduction efficiency and found that cell density had the greatest effect, which may imply a role of cell-cell interactions in this phenomenon.</p>
            <br>
            <img alt="figure quantifying transduction efficiency for high-density cells with adjuvants" class="figure" src="../images/paper2-figure4.png">
            <p class="paper-text">In Figure 4, the researchers demonstrate that a combination of PGE2 and P407 can further increase the amount of cells that express GFP as well as the vector copy number.</p>

                <img alt="figure showing mouse transplantation experiment" class="figure" src="../images/paper2-figure5.png">
                <p class="paper-text">Up to this point, the experiments described in this paper have been performed in vitro. In order to bridge the gap to human health application, the researchers employed a mouse transplantation experiment to assess the efficiency of xenografting.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="paper-text">The researchers transduced low- and high- density cell cultures with a GFP-encoding lentiviral vector, then transplanted these cells into immunocompromised mice. After assessing expression of GFP, they found that the high-density cell culture yielded increased GFP expression after transplantation, with similar % engraftment in peripheral blood cells.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="paper-text"> The results described in this study offer insight into a potential avenue for improving existing stem cell therapies with some preliminary insight into the potential mechanisms at play.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="paper-text">A crucial note about these findings is that transducing with higher cell densities may not be a universal optimization strategy, especially for adhesive cells which may face decreased fitness in crowded environments.</p>
