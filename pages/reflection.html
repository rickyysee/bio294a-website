    <h2 class="top">Reflection</h2>
    <p>This course, although only a seminar, allowed me to have some fruitful conversations with people who have great ideas about science. I believe at the graduate-level, most of our learning happens through discussions with our peers as well as through trying to teach others. I feel as though I was able to learn a lot about many different concepts of biology, which may be largely due to my desire to not leave questions I have unanswered. This course has allowed me to exercise my ability to comprehend and critique scientific literature, which will continue to be important for the rest of my academic career and learning beyond.<br><br>Possibly the most significant takeaways I have from this course are the new relationships I have formed with others. In academia, especially at the graduate-level, it is important to communicate with others as that is truly how most science is performed. I am grateful to have met other scientists, my peers and instructor, who are very knowledgeable in different areas of biology.</p>
    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <p>I feel like the the freedom that this course offered us in our approach of assignments was very beneficial. Overall, the course introduced interesting topics in an appropriate manner for a graduate-level course.</p>

    <ol style="margin-top: 0px;">
        <li style="color: rgb(39, 136, 73);">The amount of papers we covered was great (not too much)</li>
        <li style="color: rgb(218, 26, 26);">Discussion sessions might need some guidance for better participation</li>
        <li style="color: rgb(218, 26, 26);">Methods sessions could be more specified to their paper
            <ul style="padding-left: 0px">
                <li style="margin-left: 20px;">This would give more time for discussion in journal club</li>
